    # title, which is limited to a length of 200 characters

    # author, which is a foreign key that follows a many to one relationship (an author can have one to many posts,
    # but not the other way around); the reference is to the built in User model that Django provides for authentication;
    # for all many-to-one relationships, such as ForeignKey, we must also specify an on_delete option

    # this method tells Django how to calculate the canonical URL for our model object; it says to use the URL named
    # post_detail and pass in the pk.
